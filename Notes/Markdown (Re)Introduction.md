# Headings
To create headings use hash symbol (#)
we an create multiple levels by using multiple hashes
## This is a subheading level 2

### this is a level 3 subheading

###### level 6 is the smallest

# Modifying Text Style
We can use asterisks (\*) to modify text style, specifically bold and italics
I want this **word** to be bold
I want this _word_ to be italicized
this **_word_** is both bold and italicized
***This sentence is emphasized
*hello* hello** ***hello

## Aside: Escape characters
if we want to place a character that is already a **keyword** or **reserved character** we use the back slash ( \\ )
## Strikethrough
we can strike through characters or words using the tide (~)
e.g
Mr. Ubial knows how to spell ~~hi~~

# Blockquotes

block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text, We can use (>) to create blockquotes

e.g.

>This is an example of a example
  This is line two of a blockquote


# Lists
We can create both ordered and unordered lists

# Unordered Lists
to create each point, we use asterisks (\*)
We can create a sub portion of the lists by placing **Tabs**

e.g.

* Dairy
	* eggs
	* milk
	* dairy
	* cheese
	
* juice

# Ordered Lists
We use numbers followed by periods to make a ordered lists.

e.g.

1. put butter into bowl
2. add sugar to butter ( hold shift to create a second line)
   Both brown and white sugar
3. using the mixture, add cream


# Tables
We can organize information in tables using Markdown.
We can use (-) and pipes (|).

Tables in Markdown require a heading

e.g.

| Name    | Age     | Sign     |
| ---     | ---     | ---      |
|Mr. Ubial|unaging  | Super strength|
|Bob | 10  | good |
